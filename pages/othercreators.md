### Connection to Knight Family

This recipe's connection to the family is difficult to determine. It was given to T.R. and Angie Knight at their wedding in 1998, but there is no writing on the recipe indicating who was the recipe's creator, and attempts to identify the recipe by reaching out to other family members have been unsuccessful.
